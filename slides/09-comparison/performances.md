## Performances

Both frameworks are built for `Object.observe`

Ember.js has a better performance out of the box, cashing of the computed values

AngularJS can get to many scopes. When performance issues occur (ie infinite scroll) directives can be use to compile the DOM and remove scopes.

AngularJS:

**82 kb**

Ember.js: 

**230 kb** = 

**64 kb** of ember.js + **74 kb** of handlebar.js + **92 kb** of jQuery
