## Concepts

---

### Single page application

- A new name for rich interface application

### Why bother?

- Responsive UI
- Potential to share API
- Uninterupted navigation and media playback

good user experience on the mobile phones.

### Clients-side templates

Data is often exchanged using JSON and injected in client-side templates

---

### MVC as in *Model View Controller*

Slightly different approaches for each framework

---

### Two-way data binding

Hard to do in jQuery or Backbone without an external library

---

## AngularJS only:

- Dependency Injection
- Directives
- Filters
