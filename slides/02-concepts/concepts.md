## Concepts

---

### Single page applications!

---

- A new name for rich interface application
- The client becomes “fat” again

<aside data-markdown class="notes">
Architecture: 2-tier => 3-tier => 2.5-tier?

Fat especially for the memory
</aside>

---

### Why bother?

- No full page realods = more responsive UI
- Potential to share API with mobile application
- Uninterupted media playback

<aside data-markdown class="notes">
Better user experience on mobile phones slow connections.

Ideal for apps that stay open all day long (e.g. ticketing software)
</aside>

---

### Clients-side templates

Data is exchanged using JSON and

injected in client-side templates

---

### MVC: Model View Controller

Slightly different approaches for each framework

…more on this later

---

### Two-way data binding

Hard to do in jQuery or Backbone

without an external library

---

## Dependency Injection

Present in both frameworks; shown more prominently in AngularJS

## Directives and Web Components

Isolated and reusable building blocks
